# Data visualization with Python course

© 2016 Randal S. Olson

In this repository, you'll find course materials for teaching data visualization with Python. I'll be developing these teaching materials over time to provide a hands-on course that will take you from a beginner to intermediate level of programming data visualizations.

Some of these materials are based on the video course I developed with O'Reilly called [Data Visualization Basics with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do).
